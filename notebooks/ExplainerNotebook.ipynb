    "This system connects multiple layers of decision-making into a structured pipeline, helping simulate how various authorities might coordinate during an active wildfire scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented four specialized agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evacuation Coordinator: identifies high-risk towns and recommends evacuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Resource Planner: optimally deploys firefighting units based on available trucks, helicopters, and severity levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Tourism Safety Advisor: assesses risk to tourists and recommends travel guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Public Communication Manager: synthesizes all outputs into a final alert message.\n",
    "\n",
    "These agents use  fire probability and severity outputs inputs to simulate realistic emergency response.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multi-agent system is embedded in a Streamlit application, allowing users (e.g., municipalities, emergency planners) to select a region and date. It fetches simulated weather data, estimates fire risk, and runs the agents to produce a public-facing alert.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interconnections:\n",
    "\n",
    "Our agent system consumes the outputs of the ensemble-based fire prediction and spread models, which estimate the likelihood and severity of fires from weather data. This connects statistical modeling with high-level decision logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our Resource Planner agent could later use real or simulated resource availability data, helping prioritize areas when firefighting capacity is limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "SPI’s (Societal Performance Indicators): The decisions generated by our agents ( how many towns to evacuate or alert tourists) can feed directly into impact metrics used by other team members, such as number of people affected, economic risk zones, or alert coverage.\n",

Its purpose is to demonstrate how LLM-powered agents can assist decision-makers during wildfires by simulating role-based reasoning, ensuring public safety communication, and enabling better resource planning. It connects technical outputs (models, forecasts) to societal-level actions, directly supporting the project’s goal of AI for the Betterment of Society.\n",

We use a custom risk formula, based on temperature, wind speed, and humidity(fire_probability, fire_severity).These risk scores simulate the output of a real ML model and are fed into the agent system to trigger decisions. These heuristic-based scores act as placeholders for real model predictions and allow us to test the multi-agent logic.  "
