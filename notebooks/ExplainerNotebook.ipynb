    "\n",
    "Our solution integrates three core models and six collaborating agents to form an AI-powered wildfire prevention system:\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Core Models\n",
    "- **Fire Prediction (XGBoost):** Predicts daily wildfire risk per region using 25 years of weather data. Outputs binary labels and probability scores.\n",
    "- **Fire Spread:** Simulates wildfire expansion based on terrain and vegetation.\n",
    "- **Resource Estimation (XGBoost):** Translates fire severity into resource needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Multi-Agent System\n",
    "Agents simulate real-world emergency response roles and work together via FastAPI:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Evacuation Coordinator**: Ranks towns for evacuation.\n",
    "- **Resource Planner**: Allocates firefighting units.\n",
    "- **Tourism Safety Advisor**: Issues safety advice for tourist zones.\n",
    "- **Public Communication Manager**: Generates the final public alert.\n",
    "  \n",
    "All agents reason using structured prompts and GPT-4.1-nano, embedded in a **Streamlit interface** for real-time use.\n",
    "\n",
    "####  Interconnections\n",
    "- **Models → Agents:** Fire prediction and severity outputs feed directly into agent decisions.\n",
    "- **Agent Collaboration:** Agents pass outputs to each other, enabling coordinated evacuation, resource planning, and communication.\n",
    "- **User Interface:** Users select region and date; the system generates a public-facing safety alert with AI-driven recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Together, this design links data, prediction, and decision-making into one coordinated pipeline for wildfire response.\n",

The Meteostat API and the wildfire prediction model successfully work together and the data preprocessing files implement extensive procedures to extract all the needed information. The CrewAI-based framework effectively sets up the structure of the communication between agents. These implementations are the core elements necessary to build a multi-agent AI system.\n",
