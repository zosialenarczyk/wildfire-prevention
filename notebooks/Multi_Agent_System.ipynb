    "In the context of wildfire management, rapid and well-coordinated responses are critical for minimizing damage to ecosystems, human lives, and economic activities. Traditional decision-making processes are often hindered by the complexity and uncertainty of real-time fire events. To address these challenges, this notebook focuses on two core components:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The design, creation, and orchestration of a multi-agent system** that predicts wildfire risks, allocates resources, and generates actionable recommendations.\n",
    "- **The development of a user-friendly interface (UI)** that allows users to interact with the system, visualize risk predictions, and receive public safety alerts in real time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our system integrates multiple agents, each responsible for a distinct task:\n",
    "- **`Resource Planner`** : Strategizes optimal firefighting resource deployment.\n",
    "- **`Evacuation Coordinator`** : Prioritizes evacuation zones to safeguard human lives.\n",
    "- **`Tourism Safety Advisor`** : Assesses tourist safety and advises on travel warnings.\n",
    "- **`Public Communication Manager`** : Synthesizes information from all agents to issue clear public safety alerts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we aim to:\n",
    "- Define the roles and responsibilities of each agent.\n",
    "- Implement task descriptions tailored to real-time wildfire scenarios.\n",
    "- Coordinate agent collaboration to produce coherent, actionable outputs.\n",
    "- Build an interactive interface that visualizes fire risk predictions and displays public alerts.\n",
